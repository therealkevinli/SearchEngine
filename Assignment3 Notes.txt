What is bookkeeping.tsv and bookkeeping.json?


IDF

TF_IDF(document,token) 

doc1 = {a,b,c}
doc2 = {a d e}
doc3 = {a c g a}

TFIDf is for document ID and token
	TFIDF(doc1, token = a) = {TF = 1; DF = 3}
	term frequency of token a in doc 1 is 1
	document frequency of token a is 3 because it is in 3 documents


	IDF = {a:3, c:2, d:1, e:1 etc}



They will check REST vs rest
Google does the same
We might need to re download the clean version
